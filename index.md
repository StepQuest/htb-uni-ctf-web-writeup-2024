# Challenge Overview

The challenge begins with us being provided two addresses: one hosting a web application called Armaxis with a login form, and another simulating a mailbox.

Here, we see that account registration, login, and password recovery are available.

Here, we see a mailbox belonging to the address `test@email.htb`, which currently has no messages. There's also a button that deletes all messages from the mailbox.

# Curiosities in Code

At an earlier stage, by analyzing the relatively simple JavaScript code, we can identify the existence of the `admin@armaxis.htb` email, which is mentioned in the `/web_armaxis/challenge/views/database.js` file.

# Walkthrough

Perform a password reset for `test@email.htb`

![](assets/reset_password.png)

As a result, we will receive a random token in the mailbox, which will need to be used to reset the password.

On the password recovery page, enter the token and a new password. Then, open Burp Suite, click the button to confirm the password change, and intercept the request.

In the intercepted packet, replace `test@mail.htb` with `admin@armaxis.htb`  and forward the package. As a result, we will have successfully changed the password for the admin account.

After logging into the admin account, we are redirected to the `http://site.com/weapons` page, which appears empty. However, we can see that the Dispatch Weapon page is available.

On the Dispatch Weapon page, we see a form with multiple fields. After filling in all the fields with test values, let's check the result.

We receive a table displaying the previously entered values.

By analyzing `/web_armaxis/challenge/views/markdown.js`, we can see that it allows us to insert images. This could potentially be a vulnerability.

Let's perform a test to disclose the `/etc/passwd` file. First, we need to find the request in Burp Suite's history where we submitted the form with test values.

Replace the value of the `note` field with `![url](file:///etc/passwd)` and send the request. In the response, we can see that our "weapon" has been successfully dispatched.

On the weapons table page, let's download our image.

![](assets/img_etc_passwd.png)

Finally, we open the downloaded image file. As a result, we see the successful exploitation of an LFI vulnerability, displaying the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file. Knowing this, we can easily retrieve our flag.

You can take an alternative approach by using the browser's developer tools. Copy the base64-encoded value of the image and decode it to retrieve the data. Overall, it doesn't matter which method you choose to go with.

# Solution

Repeat the step with modifying the `note` field value, but this time use `![url](file:///flag.txt)`.

After downloading the new image from the table and opening the file, we will obtain our flag.
